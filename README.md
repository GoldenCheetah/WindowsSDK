# WindowsSDK
The SDK provides pre-compiled libraries for all GoldenCheetah dependencies which are currently part of the official release
build - you find all details in the "ReadMe.txt" which is part of the .zip archive. Due to size reasons the complete
SDK is provided via "releases" here in GitHub. Check the "releases" page for the latest version.

The currently supported toolchain is:
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015
- Qt 5.9.3 for MSCVC 2015 (64bit)

The SDK will always be a "pre-release" and is intended for personal use only.
